# Demo/Template project for GraphQL

Create a web application with CRUD functionality using GraphQL for the problem described below:

-	A Farm has many chickens and a chicken can have many eggs.

-	We want to be able to:
        -	See how many chickens are on a farm.
        -	Delete chickens off the farm.
        -	See how many eggs a chicken has produced.
        -	Add/update eggs produced by a chicken.

This is a demo project utilizing an in-memory H2 database alongside a GraphQL interface that exposes CRUD functionality.
