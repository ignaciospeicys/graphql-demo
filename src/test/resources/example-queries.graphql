#this file contains several example queries utilized to test the API
#these can be used in several different ways:
#   1)via GraphiQL (graphical interface exposed at /graphiql).
#   2)via HTTP using clients such as POSTMAN. If in doubt, read "serving over http" on GraphQL's official documentation.

#adds a new farm
mutation {
    addFarm(name:"Sunshine Land") {id name}
}

#adds a new chicken linked to a farm of id: 1
mutation {
    addChicken(name:"Claudio",age: 2, breed: "white", farmId: 1) {id name age}
}

#queries for a chicken of id: 2, and requests the following fields
query {
    chickenById(id: 2) {
        id
        name
        age
    }
}

#queries the exact same chicken as before, but it requests the name of the farm the chicken belongs to, as well.
query {
    chickenById(id: 2) {
        id
        name
        age
        farm {
            name
        }
    }
